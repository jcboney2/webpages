    <h2>Welcome to my page about myself, Jackson Boney!</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name is Jackson Boney and I am currently a freshman at NC State
    University. My major is Biological engineering and I have chosen this major 
    because all my life I have loved working with plants and I want to be able to 
    create plants that are more sustainable for our ever changing world. Also 
    throughout my life I have always enjoyed working with plants and their components.</p>
    <br />
    <p>As of this moment in time I am not working because I am a full time college
    student. As of fall in 2022 though I will be an RA for NC State. I have chosen to do
    this for two reasons. One it does not pay amazingly but the benefits are outstanding
    and two, I want to be able to help all of the incoming freshman transition because
    it is not an easy process and I am so thankful for my RA who was so helpful. In the
    future, I would like to have a job in which I can either genetically modify plants
    or work on a farm and design better irrigation systems and other such tasks. </p>
