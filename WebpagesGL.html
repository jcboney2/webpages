    <p>Hey!!!! My name is Jackson, and I am a current freshman at NC State University.
    I am originally from Hamlet, North Carolina, and I have lived there all my life.
    I hope to go into Biological engineering and plan on working in a field that
    allows me to work with plants, whether it be genetics of the plant or determining
    the soil for which the plant grows the best. As of now I do not have a job but I 
    plan on being an RA next semester. </p>
